# solana-stock-prediction-dapp

This is a sample project, with a smart contract written in Rust lang & the Anchor framwork for Solana. The smart contract uses the Pyth network for real stock price data, and allows two players to make bets on price movements for various stocks. The winner gets to the keep twice the bet, while the loser gets nothing. If both parties happen to get a draw, then they both get their amount of SOL back.
